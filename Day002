        <h1> NOUN</h1>
        <p style="color : green"> According to an old definition given by primary school teachers to students, a noun is the name of any person, animal, place or things. This has been refined to give a simple definition of noun as <i>a naming word</i>. Imagine if the archaic definition was in use, what kind of noun will you classify love as ?? (funny right). Examples of noun includes Ayomide, John, Sandra, Lagos, cat, Cold, pack, Plate etc reference <a href="http://www.Learner.com"> Go to http://www.Learner.com</a>. There are six types of noun.</p>
        <h2> Types of noun</h2>
        <p>1. Proper noun: A proper noun is a type of noun in which the first letter is always capitalized e.g Nigeria, Lagos, Abuja.</p>
        <p>2. Common noun: The first letter of this type of noun is always in lower case e.g school, market, love, cat etc.</p>
        <p>3. Collective noun: From the name of this type of noun, it is vivid that it is a type of noun used to group two or more noun together e.g pack, group, legion, shoal, packet etc.</p>
        <p> 4. Abstract noun: This is a type of noun that can only be felt but cannot be seen or touched e.g sad, happy, like, love, hatred, cold ( Do you know it is correct to say I'm catching a cold.) etc.</p>
